This code was written expressly to learn about the Anyma uDMX interface and
how to work with it using Python and pyusb on a raspberry pi (RPi).
Much of the learning started with the C++ based uDMX utility written
by Markus Baertschi (https://github.com/markusb/uDMX-linux). Many thanks
to Markus for this work.

After gaining enough knowledge on how to use pyusb, my next step will be
to write a Python version of the uDMX utility (which I will push to my github
accuont). Hopefully, the combination of tryusb.py and uDMX.py will provide 
a good base for others wanting to work with an inexpensive DMX interface on an RPi.

Side Note: You can find a number of clone uDMX interfaces on eBay. The one
used for this exercise was purchased from tomtop_auction
http://www.ebay.com/usr/tomtop_auction?_trksid=p2047675.l2559
This is not an endoresement or recommendation. It is just information in
case you are looking for a uDMX type of interface.
"""

# Requires a venv with pyusb installed. See requirements.txt.

# In order to directly access a USB port, you must be running sudo.
# This appears to be the recommended way to activate the venv
# when running under sudo. However, it hard wires the venv to this script.
# At a minimum we need a runtime test so the work aroud is only executed
# when running on an RPi.
