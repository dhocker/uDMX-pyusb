# Programming the Anyma uDMX interface (and clones) Using Python
Copyright Â© 2016 by Dave Hocker (AtHomeX10@gmail.com)

## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to share what I have learned about programming the
Anyma uDMX interface using Python and PyUSB on the Raspberry Pi (RPi). Th Anyma uDMX
interface is relatively inexpensive and there are a large number of clones available 
from sites like eBay. However, there seems to be a dearth of information available for
programming this interface under Linux.

Many thanks go out to Markus Baertschi and the work he did on the uDMX-linux utility
(see https://github.com/markusb/uDMX-linux). His C++ based uDMX utility served as the basis
for the majority of my learnng exercise. 
My next project will be a Python version of the uDMX utility.

## Build Environment

This work is written in Python 2.7.
A suitable development environment would use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to create a working virtual environment.
The requirements.txt file can be used with pip to create the required virtual environment with all dependencies.

## Programs

### tryusb.py
This was my first learning tool. It does the following:

  * Locates the uDMX interface
  * Prints some information about the interface
  * Sends some basic commands to a Venue ThinPar64 demonstrating how to manipulate the light via DMX.

It also helped me resolve some issues with permissions on the RPi. To run this app:

sudo python tryusb.py

### uDMX.py
TBW
